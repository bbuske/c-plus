# Hello World! - The beginning of C++ Programming

This is a simple program, written in C++. It does nothing more than printing the words "Hello World!" to the console or terminal. 

## How to Run: 

It is probably the most famous phrase and for many it is the beginning of the programmer career. In order for the file to run, it 
might actually be necessary to compile it first. You can compile it by using the following command in Linux or Mac: 
  
  g++ hello.cpp -o hello 

or by using just 

  g++ hello.cpp
  
  In both cases an executable file will be created, which can then be run locally on the computer. 
  Note: If you are using an IDE, chances are high, that it contains a compiler already. In this case, all you have to do is open 
  the file in the IDE and run it from within the IDE, using the respective options or - if the IDE comes with an own console - use 
  the above compiles command in it. 
  
## Other stuff: 
  
  If you have any questions or need help, please do not hesitate to comment! 
  
  You are free to use and share this piece of code, as you wish. It would be nice, if you would mention where and how you got it 
  though, whereever you are going to publish it. 
  
  Cheers!
