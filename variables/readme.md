# C++ Variables, Variable Types and Arithmetic Operators 

Here I am dealing with variables and variable types in C++. The files found here, while they can be executed, mainly show how
variables are assigned and what types of variables exist in C++. I will also look a bit into arithmetic operators, how they can 
be used and what they are.  

## Types of Variables in C++ 

In C++ there are the following types of variables: 

* int (integer) >> stores full (integer numbers)
* float >> stores decimal (floating numbers)
* double >> same as float, but higher precision and allows for longer numbers. Double should be preferred way
* bool >> stores a true or false value 
* char >> stores a chracter 
* wchar_t >> a wide character type
* void >> represents the absence of type.

## Arithmetic Operations 

With values and especially values stored in variables, you can do arithmetic operations and calculations. Operators used are: 

+ >> Addition
- >> Substraction
* >> Multiplication
* >> \/ Division
* >> \% Modulo

The modulo is a special operator, that provides a remainder of a division. So for example 12 / 5 divides 12 by 5. 12 % 5 provides
the remainder of the division 12 / 5. The result of 12 % 5 is 2! 12 / 5 is 2, which sums up to 10. The remainder is 2 (10 - 12 = 2) 
which is what the modulo determines.

got them though.
