# Print your Initials

With C++ you can easily print your initials onto the screen or into the console. The code snipped provided here, shows you how 
this is working. The reason, this actually works is, because C++ recognizes all whitespaces within the "" in the cout command. 
So with some work you can easily print out letters or even whole words - not just your initials. 

## How to run this program

In order to run this program, you must compile it first. If you do not use an IDE with an integrated compiler / run option,
you can compile using the terminal / command line by writing g++ initials.cpp -o initials. This will create an executable file 
named initials, which can then be run in the termnial, using ./initials.
